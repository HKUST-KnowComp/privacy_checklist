This caller, like many others, found themselves in a situation where sharing sensitive health information was imperative to receive the necessary medical assistance. The recipient of this call was the 911 Dispatch Service, a crucial emergency service provider trained to respond to such calls with promptness and efficiency.The heart of this story lies in the interaction between the caller and the 911 dispatch. The caller, driven by the urgency of the medical emergency, implicitly consented to share protected health information (PHI) with the dispatch service. This information included details that could identify the nature of the emergency, symptoms, and potentially even the identity of the individual in distress.

The Ohio Legal Rights Service (OLRS), a protection and advocacy system designated under federal and Ohio law to protect the rights of mentally ill persons, stepped in to investigate the allegations of abuse and neglect. To do so, OLRS sought access to two specific types of records: one relating to the wrist injury of the 13-year-old and another concerning the facility's logs of seclusion and restraint practices.Despite OLRS's authority and mandate, The Buckeye Ranch initially resisted providing these records, citing the child's privacy and legal restrictions on sharing medical information.

The attending officers, led by Officer Matthew Marino, noted Smith's apparent state of alcohol impairment, marked by bloodshot eyes, slurred speech, and a continued strong odor of alcohol. Despite these observations, Smith refused to submit to a blood test, challenging the officer to obtain a warrant.Adhering to legal protocols, Officer Marino secured a search warrant to obtain Smith's medical records from the hospital, which documented an elevated blood alcohol level at the time of treatment. This evidence became a pivotal point in the investigation, leading to Smith's charge of driving while impaired.The legal proceedings that followed saw Smith challenge the admissibility of his medical records, citing violations of the physician-patient privilege, state health information disclosure laws, and federal  regulations. The crux of the dispute centered on whether the acquisition of Smith's medical records through a search warrant was permissible under , specifically under the provision allowing for the disclosure of health information for law enforcement purposes without patient consent.The case unfolded amidst complex interpretations of privacy rights, the scope of law enforcement authority, and the intricate balance between individual liberties and public safety. As the court deliberated, the foundational question remained: whether the compelled disclosure of Smith's medical records, critical to substantiating the charge of impaired driving, stood in violation of privacy protections or aligned with the exceptions granted under  for law enforcement activities.", "information_type": "Medical Records including blood alcohol level and any statements made concerning the motor vehicle accident", "purpose": "Criminal Investigation"}, {"refer_ids": ["164.508(c)(1)(vi)", "164.512(e)", "164.512(e)(1)(ii)(A)", "164.508(c)(1)"], "sender": "Individuals (Lesha Carter and Jazyhia Carter)", "subject": "Patients", "recipient": "Healthcare Providers", "norm_type": "negative_norm", "context": "In this case, Lesha Carter and her minor child, Jazyhia Carter, were involved in a legal dispute with their healthcare providers over alleged negligent medical treatment.

Northwest, aiming to strengthen its case, issued a subpoena duces tecum to WRMC. This legal demand was not ordinary; it sought detailed information about every patient Dr. Senter had seen or treated since his tenure began at WRMC up until a specified date. The request was comprehensive, asking for patient names (which could be anonymized), dates of service, and the nature of medical services rendered by Dr. Senter. The purpose was clear: to underpin Northwest's legal strategy with concrete data on Dr. Senter's professional engagements post his departure from Northwest.WRMC, faced with this subpoena, was thrust into a complex situation. Protecting patient privacy is a fundamental responsibility for healthcare providers, enshrined in  regulations. WRMC objected to the subpoena on several grounds, including the protection of health information under  and the potential breach of patient confidentiality, despite the absence of direct patient consent for such a disclosure. The tension between legal obligations and patient privacy rights was palpable.The case escalated to a judicial level, where arguments were heard, and the court's wisdom sought.

The fine was $20. The citation was printed electronically and placed underneath one of the windshield-wipers on his vehicle. Senne discovered it approximately five hours after it was placed on the vehicle. The citation included personal information about Senne \u2014 his name, address, driver\u2019s license number, date of birth, sex, height, and weight. The information came from motor vehicle records maintained by the Illinois Secretary of State. The directions on the citation stated that the recipient could pay the fine in person or request a hearing. The citation also doubled as an envelope, and the directions said to use it if paying by mail. The complaint does not say if Senne followed those directions, but because personal information appeared on the outside of the citation-turned-envelope, anyone who came across it could have viewed his personal information.

The blast also damaged 15 neighboring homes.On September 30, 1997, this Court signed a search warrant for the Wilson Road location. On October 1,1997, the Court signed a search warrant for Riccio\u2019s home, which is located at 837 North DuPont Street, Wilmington, Delaware. On October 15, 1997, the search warrants were returned, and the State filed a motion to seal the warrants, the affidavits of probable cause, and the returns for a period of 90 days. After reviewing the documents, this Court granted the State\u2019s motion to seal.On October 16, 1997, The News Journal Company (hereafter referred to as \u201cInterve-nor\u201d or \u201cNews Journal\u201d) filed a motion to intervene, a motion to expedite proceedings, and a motion to unseal the documents connected with the searches of the two homes. Because no rule or statute precludes such intervention, and, in fact, Delaware courts have generally allowed it, this Court granted the motion to intervene and the motion to expedite the proceedings. See Gannett Co., Inc. v. State, Del.Supr., 565 A.2d 895, 899 (1989) (\u201cGannett I\u201d); Van Arsdall v. State, Del.Supr., 486 A.2d 1 (1984); State v. Shipley, Del.Super., 497 A2d 1052 (1985). The State filed its memorandum opposing the motion to unseal on October 23, 1997. On October 24, 1997, the Court heard oral argument on the motion to unseal. The issues are now ripe for decision.II. ISSUESThe News Journal argues first that it has a \u201cpresumed right of access\u201d to pre-indictment search warrants and supporting documentation under both the First Amendment and the common law and that the result of the analysis is the same under either standard. (Intervenor\u2019s Memorandum at 10, hereafter referred to as \u201cInt. Mem. at page no.\u201d). The State responds that every court that has addressed this issue has denied the press access to sealed pre-indictment search warrant documentation. (State\u2019s Memorandum at 1, hereafter referred to as \u201cSt. Mem. at page no.\u201d).Second, the News Journal contends that even if the Court finds no First Amendment or common law right of access to the search warrant documentation, the Court should excise sensitive portions of the documentation and release a redacted version. (Int. Mem. at 6.)Finally, the News Journal argues that before a court may issue an order depriving the public of its First Amendment rights, the court must give notice of the proposed order and allow interested parties to be heard so that they may challenge the order.

Ms. Kelly did not have her license with her, informing the officer that she had forgotten it in her hotel room. The officer administered a \u201cDWI\u201d test on Ms. Kelly, which she passed. Nevertheless, the officer placed her under arrest for the traffic violations and had her transported to Central Lock-Up in Orleans Parish. The arresting officer did not search Ms. Kelly or the car, nor did he ask for the vehicle registration.At Central Lock-Up, Ms. Kelly turned over a tote bag which she had been carrying containing her wallet, check book, various credit cards, her airline ticket, her address book and other personal items, and was placed in a holding cell. Before being placed in a second holding cell, Ms. Kelly was pat-down searched. The deputy who. searched her did not notice the asthma inhaler and American Express card which she had forgotten in her pockets. While at Central Lock-Up, Ms. Kelly was allowed to use a telephone, and contacted her husband in Connecticut and a sister living in Baton Rouge.After being placed in a third holding cell, Ms. Kelly was shackled and handcuffed and transferred to the female detention facility. Upon arriving at the detention facility, Ms. Kelly was escorted to a room where a female deputy strip-searched her. The deputy ordered Ms. Kelly to remove her clothes and then to turn around, bend over, spread her buttocks and cough, so that the deputy could visually inspect Ms. Kelly\u2019s vaginal and rectal cavities.Ms. Kelly put her clothes back on, and was escorted to another room, where she and another arrestee were ordered to undress. Ms. Kelly was then sprayed with disinfectant on her crotch, breasts and head.After showering, Ms. Kelly placed her street clothes in a bag and received a prison uniform, but she forgot to hold on to her asthma inhaler.

Because McDonald had previously been convicted of a felony, he was charged under \u00a7 922(g)(1) for being a felon in possession of a firearm. McDonald moved to suppress evidence pertaining to the gun, initially arguing that the officers should not have pulled him over because the anonymous tip alone was not sufficient evidence to provide probable cause to stop him. The government responded, however, that McDonald was actually stopped because he used his turn signal but never turned onto a different street. The officers believed that was a traffic offense under 625 111. Comp. Stat. 5/ll-804(d) (2005). McDonald responded that \u00a7 5/11\u2014 804 did not prohibit his actions and that Officer Pearce\u2019s mistake of law could not justify a traffic stop.Officer Pearce testified at the hearing on the motion, stating that the police received a tip claiming that a black male driving a maroon Buick possessed drugs and a handgun. Later that night, the officers saw a car matching that description and began to follow it. When the driver flashed his turn signal at a ninety-degree curve in the road where the road changed names, Officer Pearce stopped the car.

The Parole Commission still exists to monitor these individuals and the statutes, while repealed, remain in force as applied to those individuals. Plaintiff was released on parole in 1997, revoked and returned to prison in 1999 and re-released in 2000. Plaintiffs parole continues until March 26, 2006.Two years before Plaintiff was convicted, Congress passed the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1994, which required that persons convicted of murder or sex offenses under federal and military law provide a DNA sample to be included in the Combined DNA Index System (\u201cCO-DIS\u201d), a national database. The database allows federal and state law enforcement officers to check evidence found at crime scenes of both past and future crimes, against offenders who have provided a sample. Nearly every state has a similar statute and samples collected by state entities are also included in CODIS.Courts have reviewed a number of DNA collection statutes, and found them to not be penal in nature. Most recently, the Kansas Supreme Court found that its DNA collection law did not constitute a penalty but rather established a process for assisting the identification and detection of crimes. That court held that \u201c[sjtate action in furtherance of achieving those goals is not a penalty or a punishment.\u201d Other courts have held the same.In 2001, the law was amended by the passage of the USA Patriot Act. The Patriot Act extended the DNA sample requirement to other qualifying federal and military felonies, including Kidnaping. Thus, while Plaintiff was on parole, his parole officer advised him that the conditions of his parole now required him to provide a sample of his DNA for inclusion in the database. In addition to adding other qualifying felonies, the Patriot Act also made it a misdemeanor for persons convicted of qualifying felonies to fail to provide a DNA sample. Plaintiff refused to give a sample and filed this lawsuit.", "information_type": "DNA sample", "purpose": "Inclusion in the Combined DNA Index System"}, {"refer_ids": [], "sender": "None", "subject": "None", "recipient": "Law Enforcement Officer", "norm_type": "not applicable", "context": "On October 5, 1999, Police Officer Charles Ramsey went to 235 Southeast 52nd Street in Oklahoma City in response to a report of shots being fired at that address.

The district court has issued numerous orders and opinions.Armstrong\u2019s original FOIA request was for all documents from the Reagan Administration found in the Professional Office System (PROFS) maintained by the Executive Office of the President (EOP) and the National Security Council (NSC). PROFS is an office automation system that contains information such as e-mail correspondence, mem-oranda, and calendars. This initial request was for an enormous number of documents.The number of documents requested has been substantially reduced over the course of this litigation. In February 1992, appellant narrowed his request to a subset of the PROFS materials. In September of that year the district court entered a stipulation and order that the government process and release PROFS materials that had already been printed out in hard copy. In January 1994, the district court entered another order, further narrowing the scope of appellant\u2019s request and ordering the government to comply. The scope of the request has been further limited by an agreement between the parties.In response to these requests, the government has released a substantial number of documents, many of which have had portions redacted.

She alleges that First National accessed her consumer report and used a consumer reporting agency to target certain people, e.g., individuals with poor credit or individuals who recently obtained bankruptcy discharges, for sub-prime credit offers.Perry alleged in her complaint that First National violated 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681m(d) by failing to include a \u201cclear and conspicuous\u201d statement of certain disclosures required by the FCRA. Perry tried to introduce the report of Timothy Shanahan (\u201cShanahan report\u201d), a professor of education at the University of Illinois at Chicago, to support her argument that the Notice was not \u201cclear and conspicuous.\u201d The Shanahan report included a \u201clegibility analysis.\u201dThe district court found that Perry did not have a statutory right to bring a private cause of action under \u00a7 1681m(d), due to a 2003 amendment to the FCRA that eliminated the right to bring such actions. The district court therefore granted summary judgment for First National.

TPS is a privately-held telecommunications company which provides a \u201cpersonal assistant\u201d service to its customers. A TPS customer using this service is assigned a single telephone number, and the customer\u2019s incoming calls are routed to any one of several other telephone numbers used by the customer. TPS allegedly purchased the facsimile number list containing Foxhall\u2019s number from a marketing services firm in New York. The list contained approximately 66,000 facsimile numbers in the New York metropolitan tristate area.Foxhall filed this putative class action suit on behalf of itself and all New Yorkers who allegedly received \u201cjunk\u201d facsimile advertisements from TPS. Foxhall claims that the advertisement it received was sent without its prior permission and was therefore a violation of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227. Section 227(b)(1)(C) prohibits the \u201cuse [of] any telephone facsimile machine, computer, or other device to send an unsolicited advertisement to a telephone facsimile machine.\u201d Section 227(b)(3) provides for a private right of action in the following terms:A person or entity may, if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a State, bring in an appropriate court of that State \u2014 \u2022(A) an action based on a violation of this subsection or the regulations prescribed under this subsection to enjoin such violation,(B) an action to recover for actual monetary loss from such a violation, or to receive $500 in damages for each such violation, whichever is greater, or(C) both such actions.If the court finds that the defendant willfully or knowingly violated this subsection or the regulations prescribed under this subsection, the court may, in its discretion, increase the amount of the award to an amount equal to not more than 3 times the amount available under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(b)(3).Following International Science, the district court held that the TCPA creates a private right of action for violations of \u00a7 227(b)(1)(C), but that state courts have exclusive jurisdiction over such causes of action under the terms of \u00a7 227(b)(3).

Alexander v. FBI, C.A. No. 96-2123(RCL), Mem. and Order at 6 (D.D.C. Apr. 13, 1998). Pursuant to that memorandum and order, plaintiffs have pursued their theory that the White House had some role in the release of information from the federal security-clearance form of Linda Tripp. To this end, plaintiffs served Clifford Bernath, former Principal Deputy Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, with a subpoena ad testificandum and duces te-cum.The subpoena commanded Bernath to appear for deposition on April 24, 1998. On April 23, the government defendants filed a motion for protective order with respect to the deposition of Bernath.

The Government's assertion that disclosure of the legal materials, testimony, and ultimate Order would jeopardize both the then-current and subsequent criminal investigations of future cases (both categories involving and emanating from Title III wiretap processes) was a valid and legitimate factual and legal concern; and2. Facebook's assertion that its internal processes that were the subject of the Government's motion constituted trademark and protected material and information, and that public disclosure would provide such protected information to competitors, thereby jeopardizing substantial business quality, productivity, and profit, was legitimate, true, and reasonable.The Government opposes the instant requests to unseal. Facebook supports the requests on the condition that any disclosed materials be subject to limited redaction.The issues raised by the requests to unseal are:\u2022 whether the public has First Amendment and common law rights of access to the court records sought; and\u2022 if so, whether the Government has articulated compelling reasons that outweigh the public's right of access.", "information_type": "Legal documents and responses ", "purpose": "Request to unseal court records "}, {"refer_ids": [], "sender": "Law enforcement", "subject": "Drug dealer", "recipient": "None", "norm_type": "not applicable", "context": "For much of 1991 and 1992 Harrison ran a drug business out of various apartments at 601 Virginia Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C.

McLane, concerned that Sprauer might be intoxicated, summoned Stuart Police Officer Matthew Cernuto to the scene because Cernuto\u2019s vehicle contained a video camera. The officers gave Sprauer roadside sobriety tests which were videotaped, and administered traffic citations, but did not arrest Sprauer for driving under the influence of alcohol.Thereafter, the Jupiter Police Department obtained a copy of the videotape of the field sobriety tests from the Stuart Police Department. An internal affairs investigation was commenced by Jupiter Police Chief Frank Kitzeimw to determine if Sprauer had violated the police department\u2019s rules and if discipline was warranted. Kitzerow assigned Captain Scott De Atley and Lieutenant David England to conduct the investigation. The investigators found, inter alia, that Sprauer drove under the influence of alcohol on December 20, 2006 and improperly attempted to use his position as a police officer to avoid arrest. A pre-termination hearing was held before Kitzerow, after which he concluded that Sprauer was impaired when stopped by the Stuart police. Kitzerow recommended to Jupiter Town Manager Andrew Lukasik that Sprauer be disciplined for policy violations, and possibly terminated. Lukasik issued a letter, rejecting Sprauer\u2019s contention that the videotape had been \u201ctampered with in an effort to develop a case\u201d against him, and terminating Sprauer\u2019s employment.

Mother has had sole custody of Ivey since her birth.In April 2016, Mother obtained a domestic violence protective order (\"DVPO\") against Father. According to the DVPO, on 18 March 2016, Father went to Mother's home late at night unannounced, banged on her door, and threatened to kill her. Father assaulted Mother by hitting and choking her. The DVPO was in effect for one year, until April 2017. The DVPO ordered Father not to have any contact with Mother, but did not forbid contact with any minor children residing with her.In March 2017, one month before the DVPO was set to expire, Father filed a pro se civil complaint for visitation with Ivey. That same day, Mother filed a petition to terminate Father's parental rights to Ivey alleging the grounds of failure to establish paternity, failure to pay support, and abandonment. See N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-1111(a)(5), (4), and (7) (2017). Mother alleged Father had not contacted or seen Ivey since March 2015 and had not paid any financial support.In February 2018, following a hearing on the matter, the trial court entered an order terminating Father's parental rights to Ivey, concluding that Father had failed to pay child support and had abandoned Ivey and that termination of Father's parental rights was in Ivey's best interests.

In July 2001, Cole arranged for a meeting with this girl at a local mall, and was arrested when he arrived at the appointed meeting place.Cole was charged with enticement of a child and attempted sexual assault on a child. After a jury trial of three days, the jury returned a guilty verdict on the enticement count, but was unable to reach a verdict on the attempted assault count. Cole subsequently agreed to admit to a previous sex offense, and in exchange, the prosecution dismissed the attempted assault count.

Once there, he was met by Phillips who invited him into the kitchen where the officer purchased cocaine from Phillips and gave Phillips the recorded money. The officer left the house and proceeded to a car parked nearby where other police officers were waiting.

Once at the station, Magnu-son was questioned regarding her parents\u2019 opinion of Manuel, whether Manuel was affiliated with a streetgang, his birthplace, and any possible drug use. After this questioning, she and her baby were driven home by a police officer. No charges were filed against Magnuson in connection with this incident.I", "information_type": "Personal identifying information, domestic violence information", "purpose": "Law enforcement investigation"}, {"refer_ids": [], "sender": "Law enforcement officials", "subject": "Defendant", "recipient": "Defendant", "norm_type": "not applicable", "context": "On July 9, 2004, Albert Lamont Hector (\u201cthe defendant\u201d) was charged in an indictment for possession with intent to distribute cocaine base (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846), possession of a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)), and being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1)).On September 27, 2004, the defendant filed a motion to suppress the evidence obtained on June 2, 2004, when agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (\u201cATF\u201d) and officers from the Los Angeles Police Department (\u201cLAPD\u201d) arrested the defendant and searched his apartment. During the search, the defendant was presented with a \u201cSearch Warrant Notice of Service\u201d (\u201cNotice of Service\u201d). The Notice of Service did not indicate which items the officers and agents were authorized to seize, or state the address of the premises to be searched. The government acknowledged during oral argument that the \u201cNotice of Service\u201d is not a warrant. After the defendant was booked, he apparently received a property receipt indicating what items the officers had seized. The government conceded during oral argument that at no time before, during, or immediately after the search, did it serve a search warrant on the defendant. It appears that the defendant was first provided with the search warrant as part of the government\u2019s discovery obligations.In his motion to suppress evidence, the defendant argued that the Notice of Service was inadequate under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(f) (\u201cRule 41\u201d) and the Fourth Amendment. The argument regarding Rule 41 was premised on the contention that the investigation had been \u201cfederal in character.\u201d On October 18, 2004, after determining that the investigation had not been federal in character and that Rule 41 did not apply, the Court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. The Court granted the defendant'leave to submit supplemental briefing, which was filed with the Court on October 22, 2004.On November 1, 2004, the defendant filed a motion for reconsideration of order denying motion to suppress evidence. The Court denied this motion on December 1, 2004.On December 21, 2004, a jury convicted the defendant on all three counts of the indictment.On December 27, 2004, the defendant filed his second motion for reconsideration of order denying motion to suppress evidence, which is now before the Court. The argument contained in the defendant\u2019s reply brief relies on a recent Ninth Circuit case, United States v. Martinez-Garcia, 397 F.3d 1205 (9th Cir.2005), which postdates the defendant\u2019s convictions.", "information_type": "Seized items", "purpose": "Evidence for criminal charges"}]
